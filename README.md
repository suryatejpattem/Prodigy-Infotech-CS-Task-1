The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext (the original message) is shifted by a certain number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

->A becomes D

->B becomes E

->C becomes F

For decryption, we reverse the process by shifting in the opposite direction.
